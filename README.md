# Wifi-gsm-based-substation-monitoring-system
The substation is a particularly important part of the power system network. Monitoring, Protection and Controlling of a substation plays a key role for supplying quality power to the consumer. To remotely operate a substation, we designed a Wi-Fi based communication network using ESP8266 microcontroller and Blynk application. For Monitoring of Load currents in a substation we use direct interface of thingspeak with MATLAB; For Controlling of Switches connected to the Load and for Over current Protection ESP8266 microcontroller is used. Blynk application is used to connect and disconnect loads according to user requirement. The above proposed work is implemented using MATLAB Simulink, to decrease the implementation cost and provide real time experience of substation monitoring, controlling and protection effectively.
